1) How the packages are created:

When the user presses 2 (to add a package), main entry of the program(PackageDeliveriesTracker class), passes the current packageList along with type of package(1,2,3)to OptionsHandler.
Options handler creates a new package by passing on the package choice to UserInput class's NewPackageInput (part of textui module).
In NewPackageInput, the texts for adding details of package are printed, and the input is taken and saved from the user. Depending on package type, extra input is also asked.
After all of the information are added, depending on package type, the PackageFactory.getInstance method is called along with saved information to create the package. 
Finally in Options handler's option1 function, the package is added to the end of packageList and new packageList is returned to (PackageDeliveriesTracker.

2) How the packageList is updated:  
Each time the program runs, it reads the previously saved packages from list.json and each time the program is done executing(user presses 7), list.json is updated with new packages.
This is done by calls to JSONHandler class(which had all static methods for handling JSON, WriteToJSON, ReadFromJSON) in PackageDeliveriesTracker.
